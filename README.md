## Project Focus
While the frontend plays a crucial role, my primary focus during development was on the backend. I dedicated efforts to implement robust backend functionalities, ensuring seamless interactions and reliable data management, including details about cars and user balances.

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute to the further enhancement of this carsharing service!
